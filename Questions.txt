Difference b/w sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() and sessionFactory.openSession():
openSession() creates a new normal Session, that needs to be explicitly closed once the required operations are complete.

getCurrentSession() - introduced in Hibernate 3.0 - returns a Contextual Session, which is nothing but one Session per Transaction. The Session is automatically closed once the transaction is committed. Also, it enforces the developer to make sure he uses only one session one transaction policy that hibernate recommends. Make sure that you invoke this method from within a Transactional Context, else it may throw an Exception.
