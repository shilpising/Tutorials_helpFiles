Make a class immutable which is having Date as an attribute.
	- Make class Final
	- Make member var private, final
	- No setter methods.
	- private constructors.
	- static factory method to create new instance.
		//Factory method to store object creation logic in single place
		public static ImmutableClass createNewInstance(Integer fld1, String fld2, Date date)
		{
			return new ImmutableClass(fld1, fld2, date);
		}
	- special care for mutable members. Like in getter method of mutable attribute do not retuen the refrence instead return the new instance after setting the value/content. 
	e.g. 
			/**
		* Date class is mutable so we need a little care here.
		* We should not return the reference of original instance variable.
		* Instead a new Date object, with content copied to it, should be returned.
		* */
		public Date getMutableField() {
			return new Date(mutableField.getTime());
		}
	- special care should also be taken in constructor for mutable fields:
		//Default private constructor will ensure no unplanned construction of class
		private ImmutableClass(Integer fld1, String fld2, Date date)
		{
			this.immutableField1 = fld1;
			this.immutableField2 = fld2;
			this.mutableField = new Date(date.getTime());
		}

 Core java with threading and collections. 2 technical interview followed my managerial round
 1.

Implement equals and hashcode methods  for  demo class.

Class Demo {

   private String key;

   private int value;

}

2.

Interface Demo{

m1();

m2();

}

Class A implements Demo{

m1();

m2();

m3():

}

main(){

   Demo object = new A();

    object.m3();

}

3.

Java has no concept of object immutability; this is achieved by carefully designing the object, and is a far-from-trivial endeavor.
